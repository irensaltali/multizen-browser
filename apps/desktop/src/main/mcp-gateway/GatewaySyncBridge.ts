/**
 * S3 project-config sync composition for the desktop gateway.
 *
 * When Cloud Sync becomes ready, this bridge is constructed with the SAME
 * object store + control prefix Cloud Sync uses, plus the operator encryption
 * password and the device signing key. It composes the core
 * {@link ProjectSyncCoordinator} and {@link TrustRegistrySync} — both scoped to
 * the reserved `<controlPrefix>/mcp/…` namespace, entirely separate from the
 * browser-profile keys — and runs a single-flight sync:
 *
 *   local load → remote restore/quarantine/conflicts → persist accepted →
 *   verify → hand the accepted set back for runtime reconcile.
 *
 * The gateway works fully offline: when this bridge is absent (Cloud Sync not
 * configured), the service uses local config only. Local edits are published as
 * signed envelopes with expected revisions; a lost CAS becomes a durable local
 * conflict copy (keep-both), never last-write-wins. No browser-profile deletion
 * is ever coupled to config sync.
 *
 * SECURITY: the encryption password lives only in this main-process object and
 * is passed only into the coordinator's in-memory sealing; it is never logged,
 * serialized, or exposed across IPC.
