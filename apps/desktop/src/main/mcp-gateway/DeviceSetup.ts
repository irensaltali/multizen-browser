/**
 * "Set up this device from backup" — one ordered, resumable pass that turns a
 * blank install plus a bucket into a working one.
 *
 * Every piece of this already existed and could be driven by hand: configure
 * Cloud Sync, probe the store, adopt the trust registry, pull settings, pull
 * projects, relink folders, restore credentials, restore browser profiles. The
 * problem was that "already existed" meant an operator had to know all eight
 * steps, their order, and which failures were fatal. This module encodes that
 * knowledge once.
 *
 * WHY THIS ORDER. It is not arbitrary and the stages are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   1. `storage`     — nothing else can run without bucket coordinates,
 *                      credentials, and a store that actually supports
 *                      conditional writes.
 *   2. `trust`       — every later stage verifies signatures against the trust
 *                      registry, so it has to be adopted before anything is read.
 *   3. `settings`    — cheap, and shared preferences can influence what follows.
 *   4. `projects`    — bindings and credentials are both keyed by project id, so
 *                      the projects have to exist locally first.
 *   5. `bindings`    — relinks folders to agents, which rewrites agent config
 *                      files from the projects restored in step 4.
 *   6. `credentials` — optional; writing a secret makes the servers that were
 *                      held back for a missing `${NAME}` start.
 *   7. `profiles`    — heaviest by far (it downloads snapshots) and nothing
 *                      depends on it, so it goes last where a slow or partial
 *                      run has already left a usable install behind.
 *
 * WHAT IS FATAL AND WHAT IS NOT. `storage` and `trust` are fatal: without them
 * every later stage would fail for the same reason, and reporting that reason
 * seven times is worse than reporting it once. Everything after is recorded and
 * stepped over, because a device that recovered its projects but not its browser
 * profiles is far more useful than one that recovered nothing.
 *
 * APPROVAL IS NOT REQUIRED TO RESTORE, and this is the subtlety worth stating
 * plainly. A fresh device adopts the existing trust registry and can therefore
 * VERIFY records signed by devices already in it — so reading works immediately.
 * What it cannot do is PUBLISH: its own signature is unknown until an admin
 * approves it elsewhere. So setup announces the device and reports
 * `awaitingApproval` rather than blocking on a human, and the caller can tell the
 * operator that this machine is read-only until approved.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT. Re-running is the expected way to finish an interrupted setup or to
 * retry after approval. Every stage is either a converging write (config patches,
 * secret saves) or a restore that writes the same values again.
